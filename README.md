1) Make sure you have downloaded xampp server from <https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html>

2) Click start on both Apache and MySql server

3) Can Press on Admin button for MySql, will lead you to database

4) I forgot the steps, but i think by default your xampp will be installed in either one of your main drive folders

5) Ermmm so depending on where you put your xampp folder, find htdocs.
