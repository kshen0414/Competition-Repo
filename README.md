1) Make sure you have downloaded xampp server from <https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html>

2) Click start on both Apache and MySql server

3) Can Press on Admin button for MySql, will lead you to database

4) I forgot the steps, but i think by default your xampp will be installed in either one of your main drive folders

5) Ermmm so depending on where you put your xampp folder, find htdocs.
- Example of my path / directory where I installed :

7) now open your web browser, type in the search bar beginning with. "localhost/your_folder_name/file_name"
- Reminder is that, best practice is your folder don't have spaces in between
- Also, remember to start the xampp server
